Andy got back from London two days ago and he still has jet lag. It's really annoying. We're on totally different schedules. Last night he mowed the lawn at 2:00 in the morning. Andy! Andy! - Get me a beer? - All right. As soon as I wake up, he goes down. Hard. This has to stop! Babe, wake up. That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca. Babe! You hungry, Champion? Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? Hey. Oh, man, I fell asleep again. Andy, you have got to stay up and get on a regular schedule. Were you about to spray me with the hose inside the house? - Yeah. - I kinda want you to do it now. - Okay. - Aah! Aah! Aaahhh! No, no, no, no, no, no! Okay, just a reminder, guys, today is Leslie's last day as a city councilor, so everyone be extra supportive. Already done. When she walked past me this morning, I gave her a kind nod. Heartwarming. Also I want to get her a present to cheer her up on her last day. Any ideas? A sorry you lost your dream job gift? Mm, that's a tough one. Stay away from wine. Wine is crying juice. Well, I mean, you know her better than anybody. What does she really want? More than anything in the world? A nice candle. I'm screwed. No! Andy! - An-Andy! - Oh! Come on! - Andy! - Be right out. Well, this is the Pawnee City Council chambers. Your new home away from me. Well, technically, my home away from home is in Zurich. Frank Gehry designed it. But this is nice too. Today is my last day As a--excuse me. Let me try this again. Today is my last day at C-- Today is my la-- Today is my last d-- You know what? You get the idea. My old friend Ingrid de Forest won the recall vote, and she's taking my place on Monday morning. But, you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings. And I've gone through the five stages of grief: Denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance, cat returning to the adoption place, watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown, and not giving a flying fart. How many stages is that? I don't know. The point is I'm fine now. This must be hard for you. It's like what sir Ian McKellen said to me the day I sold my boat to Karl Lagerfeld: Parting is such sweet sorrow. Oh, my God. What is your life? If it makes any difference, your work here was a real inspiration to me, and I am going to do my best to continue your legacy. Well, I appreciate the sentiment. Leslie. I'm sorry. Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud? No. But would you like to? I studied opera at the Sorbonne. I'd be happy to harmonize. Goodbye Goodbye Naw. And finally, here is a check for the entirety of the purchase of Rent-A-Swag. And here is a personal note from my client Dr. Saperstein. Dear Tom: I win. You suck. Turn note over. You still suck. Turn note over. Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself? He had to send in his lackey? My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be. Successful people, Mr. Haverford, use their money to use others to work for them. Hmm, it's an interesting idea, lawyer-dude. What if I gave you 5 bucks to put a bag of poop in Saperstein's car? No. Ballpark me. How much would it cost? $10,000. Counter-offer: Why don't you just do it for the story? Goodbye, Mr. Haverford. Is it done? Well, how many times did he turn the paper over? Oh, that is disappointing. So look at this baby. That is the most symmetrical fetus I've ever seen. This could be a superhero. - Dr. Saperstein. - Yes. I know that we should hate you because you destroyed our friend's business. - But we love you so much! - We love you! I'm loveable! So do you wanna know the sex? Oh, my God. Should we? N-no, right? Or maybe yes? Is there an option other than yes or no? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna write it down. Then I'm gonna put it in an envelope, seal it, and when you're ready, voila! - That'll be fun! - That's like the Oscars. Hey, let's get some food. I'm starving. Wait, no, I have to pee. Wait, no, I have to barf. Actually, all three. Being pregnant is great. And, finally, Larry's share of the profit. Whoa! Good to be Larry. No, it's not, you boring grandpa. Meanwhile, Tommy's ridin' high. $32,000. I'm basically a millionaire. What are you gonna do with the money, Tom? Glad you asked. A horrible man recently gave me some great advice. For years, I've been coming up with my own ideas. Like some sort of non-rich idiot. Now I'm gonna let people come to me and invest my scrilla in the best idea I hear. That sounds like an efficient use of the free market. I would wish you the best of luck, but I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures. Come hear the ideas with me, Ron. I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice. Do you think everyone here is a grandfather? Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa. And if you are a grandpa, you're dead. That sounds right. Uh, oops. This check is made out to Lenny, which I think is a typo for Larry, which isn't even actually my name. Well, tell it to the bank, Lenny. Am I--am I Lenny now? I'd like to order a singing telegram. Well, my wife lost her job, so maybe something sad and slow. Do you know anything from The Requiem for a Dream soundtrack? This is a bad idea. I'm hanging up now. Bye. Well, Ingrid is settled into my office, and this box contains the last of my stuff. Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk. Maybe I should go back for those? Honey, it's okay, there'll be other salt packets. But not the kind that snaps in half, maybe. Okay, I know I'm a broken record, but getting away from the City Council is absolutely the best thing for you. Trust me. This is Perd Hapley talking to you now about what's going on today. We're live at City Hall where City Councilman Dexhart is addressing his latest sex scandal. Recently, certain allegations have come to light about my inappropriate conduct. I'm here to set the record straight. I totally did all of it. Another sex scandal? This guy's unbelievable. How does he find the time? I also engaged in inappropriate texting, sexting, and tex-mexting, which is where you send photos of your junk from the restroom of a chili's to go. - Hmm. - Ew. Does this make me a bad boy? You tell me. No. Really. Tell me. It gets me off when women tell me that. He's reading this, he wrote this down. I sent these texts to roughly 100 women under the following pseudonyms: Enrique Shockwave, Willie Dynamite, Lee Harvey Teabag Well, at least you won't have to deal with that guy anymore. - You're right. - Lieutenant Wilhelm Von Penis. Not after someone beats him in the next election. Someone who is smart and hard-working and who knows the job because she's done it already and is also blond and named Leslie and loves you. - Is it you? - Yes! It is! I'm gonna run again. I'm gonna beat Dexhart! And Anthony Weiner. Another City Council campaign? Leslie, think about what you're saying. I did. I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan. Well, for one, we don't even live in Dexhart's district. Not yet! But we can go and rent a second apartment, and we can spend 51% of our time there. And then I'll file the campaign form from that address. I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district. It's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers. It's like a raccoon shantytown. Oh, it's not that bad. And also, Dexhart fights dirty. He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched-earth campaigns. So what? I got plenty of dirt on that scumbag. I say, Bring it on. So I'm gonna start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and-- Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath Think about if this is really worth it. Anything is worth me getting back on City Council. Okay. Let's see which one of these lucky visionaries is gonna make me rich. Greg Phillips! Hi, guys, thanks for meeting with me. Enough chitchat. What's your pitch, kid? Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge. - Let's go. - Okay. So my idea is for an abacus, but on your phone. I call it a phone-bacus. Son, you just described a calculator. Hey, but you're talking about it, right? Three words: Automated word counter. Get out. Two. Words. - No. - One. Word. As you may know, I do like to tinker with things in my garage. I'm gonna hit the can while he's up. So I think I have discovered a way to generate clean, renewable energy. I think it's gonna ch-- Oh! Gross! God, Larry. You sneezed all over us! I'm not gonna buy that thing. It's covered in a gallon of your boogers. I totally understand. Uh, jeez. I will be thrilled if we have a girl. Oh, tiny dresses? Braids? Glitter on everything? Forget it. And also, girls' names are so cute. Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly. Olive, rosemary, chicken. Fifty burritos. Oh, my God, I'm starving. Miss, hi! I'm pregnant, and I'm a little bit crazy. So if you don't bring our appetizers out in the next 30 seconds, I'm gonna plunge your face into the deep fryer! And also two waters, please. But no hurry. Thank you. Leslie, I don't know if there's a story in these emails. They're iffy, but Dexhart has been elected eight times. I don't think the voters care. His poll numbers are actually up since the scandal broke. Well, that's just because people found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin. - He is? - Good morning, Leslie. Sweet jugs. What? He's kinda cute. Oh, God, Shauna, no. I-I just feel like I could fix him, you know? This sucks! We heard a hundred pitches, and they're all terrible. Change of plans. You guys are my idea factory. - April, go. - Okay, got one. Macaroni and poison. It's like mac and cheese, but with a special ingredient. Ron? Every socket set I've ever bought only goes up to 1/2 inch. I'd love a couple larger sizes. Take it all the way up to 5/8. Andy? Bears bouncing on trampoline roads. There's a chance that I might have dreamed that. Okay, time to head back to the office. I've missed an entire day of work, so at least some good came from this. What are you doing? Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference, so I am cobbling together a banner from all the other discarded banners. Second chunce four Lesle! Perv Dexxxhrt equals - birthday mouse? - Rat! Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat. Leslie, listen to yourself. Loopholes, scorched-earth policies. This isn't you. I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this! Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office? That is not a coincidence. This was meant to be. You know what? Why don't we gather everyone in here, you explain to them what you're thinking, and, uh, we get some feedback. Now you're talking. I would be thrilled if we had a boy. I have perfected the art of shaving the human face. And I would love to be able to pass that on. Toy trucks? Superhero costumes? Tiny little acorn penis? Forget it. A weird image. But one that does not diminish my enthusiasm. Well, Ann Perkins, are you ready to find out the sex of our baby? I'm ready. We are having a distributions. That's what it looks like: Distributions. Let me see that. It says congratulations, I think. Then it says, Ileg smurf. Are we having a smurf? We are having a 11-jewel toilet. I can't tell what's words and what's punctuation! The suspense is killing me! I'm calling Dr. Saperstein. I'm calling Domino's. Do you think Domino's delivers to this restaurant? - I hope so. - Oh, no. He's out for the rest of the day! I have literally never been more stressed out. Oh, good! You guys are here! Okay, everybody gather around. I have a big announcement. I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council. I am gonna be running for Dexhart's seat. And the campaign starts now. Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer. That's what's happening, right? Leslie, no offense. I've heard a lot of bad ideas today. - This is the worst. - April? I would love it if you ran an insane campaign and basically turned into the joker. But that means you probably shouldn't do it. - Andy? - I don't know, Leslie. It seems risky. And I'd hate to see you go through another tough fight. But I could be wrong. I haven't pooped in three days. Okay, Ron, you have always given me sage counsel. And your words carry great influence so what do you think I should do? I do not think you should run again. What the hell do you know, Dum-Dum? All of you! Look, this is my only option. I am running again with or without you. Leslie, you're running for office again? What a great idea! How can I help? Ugh Well, no one else any good business ideas. So I decided to take care of it myself. Talking tissue! Any time you pull one out, you get a little message to hype you up. Blow that nose, playah! No. This stinks. I'm just gonna have to go back to my same job that I've had forever. Yeah, I get why you're bummed out. I mean, look at me. I'm younger than you, and I already have my own department. Plus I'm married, and I make more money than you. Whatever. You just merged your department with parks then made up your own title. Yeah. It's awesome. I'm empty, yo. Fill me up. Do that again. What could you possibly need at 6:00 in the morning? We couldn't read your writing, and we need to know the sex of our baby. I'm watching cartoons with my son. Daddy! An Elmer Fudd one is on! Stop it. Hey, what's up, beautiful? Jean-Ralphio. I live in the guesthouse. What do you say you and I get together in a special way? I-I'm pregnant. - The more the merrier. - With my baby. Well, you can come too, beautiful. Look at that. I guess sometimes I call men beautiful too. I guess I'm open-minded as hell. And I think you're pretty good-looking. - Thank you. - Can you just read that and tell us what the sex is, please? Wow. It looks like the chicken that wrote this had a stroke on the paper. Listen, I-I kind of remember. But I don't want to say anything that's wrong. Give me 15 minutes. I will get dressed. We'll go down to my office. Okay. Well, have a good day at work today, daddy. Also, if you don't know already, there's a malfunction with the TV, where it keeps ordering porno, like, a ton of porno. Like, how can someone watch that much porno in one sitting? Only when you're out of the house. So if you see it on the bill, that's why. Okay? And therefore, with your help, we can make our future bright. I believe I still have a lot to offer this city. I'd swap those two lines. Always helps to end on the call to action. I'm sorry if it felt like everyone piled on. We were just being honest. But if you really want to do this, of course we'll support you. Thank you. I'm sorry I stormed out. You know, I've been thinking for weeks of what to get you as a last day in City Council present. And I finally figured it out. You remember Jen Barkley, political consultant and power broker? Hey! Jen! What brings you back to Pawnee? Ben bought one hour of my time. I heard you need some consulting? Well, uh, I guess. I mean, how are you? How's your family? Okay, I get paid $1,200 an hour. Do you really wanna spend any of that time talking about my mother and her Well, that does sound fascinating. But you're right, let's talk. Okay. I'll get the chair. Ron! That's how I enter rooms now. It's more dramatic. Why did you enter at all? Because I have some huge news. You're looking at Pawnee's new business liaison. I don't like French words. I do like the word business. You may continue. April created a new position for herself, and I wanna do the same. The town could use more private-sector money after the merger. So as business liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee. Now this is a good idea. You've come a long way, son. And while I got you here talking tissue. Go for it. Yo, dog! Life is what you make of it. Leave while I'm ahead? You got it. Clear them sinuses, playboy! Someone's got the sniffies. Tell your mama you love 'er. Step up your vitamin C game, bro! So they recall me after all I've done for them. Ridiculous. But Dexhart now has another sex scandal. Of course he does. And the plan is I'm gonna run for his seat. Because how do I lose to a guy like that? - That's a great idea, right? - It's a terrible idea. I knew it. Wait. What? First of all, you could lose to a guy like that. Terrible people defeat great people all of the time. I should know. Those terrible people have paid me so much money, I have a condo in every virgin island. Now you might win. You're smart, Ben is smart, you might win. But why would you want to? Because it's my dream job. Then dream bigger. Look, you love this town. It's being run by monsters and morons? Get a better job! Rise above their heads. Affect change at a higher level. Don't be the kid that graduates high school, hangs out in the school parking lot. Be the woman who moves away, climbs the ladder, and then confidently comes back and has sex with her hot old English teacher just for kicks. Is that what you did? Yeah. Mr. Baker. Sex was pretty good, thanks to me. Look, Pawnee has done you a favor. You've outgrown them. You've got talent, and you've got name recognition. Which means that you have a bright, wide-open future with a thousand options. State Senate. Federal jobs. Even congress. All of these are doable for you. And you can trust me because I don't care enough about you to lie. Uh-oh. Oh, time's up. Okay, if you want to keep talking, you're gonna have to pay me - I just need-- - No, I swear to God, if you say one more word, you will legally owe me $1,200, and I will sue you. Let's not end it like that. Okay, great to see you, Leslie. Those five words are on me. Should I move this back? Don't answer it! I don't know what you're thinking, but you have a press conference in ten minutes. Well, this is it The final moment.. What are you hoping for? I will honestly be happy either way. Me too. Boy or girl, it doesn't matter. Because it will literally be the greatest child who's ever lived. You swear you have no preference? You? Not at all. Who's ready? Raise your hand. - It's a boy! - Yes! I thought you didn't have a preference. I didn't. I just really wanted it to be a boy. Me too. I don't know why. You guys are just so neat. Would you be interested in adopting my children? They're in their late 20s, they're terrible. No? No go? I ask all my patients. I've gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement, about my future. I will be heading to lunch today with my husband. At JJ's diner. We will eat waffles. And then we will go home and make out on our couch. That is my future. For now. It's been an honor to serve this town. And I will cherish the memories forever. Thank you. - Ms. Knope! - There you have it. A shockingly unshocking press conference in which a recently unemployed woman said nothing of importance. I'm Perd Hapley, and I just realized I'm not holding my microphone. Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was the best present I could have got. Thank you. You're welcome. But, I did get you one other present to take your mind off all this. Aww, you are the sweetest man in the world. Where is it? Well, it's not here. We have to go get it. In times of stress or in moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you. When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen to the people that love you when they're giving advice, and remember what really matters. And, if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, got to Paris! - I found one! - Oh, great! - Mm, right here. - Yeah?
