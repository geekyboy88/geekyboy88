This year marks the 50th anniversary of National Service (NS), a rite of passage for every Singaporean son, and Channel 8 is collaborating with MINDEF and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to commemorate the milestone with upcoming NS50 drama When Duty Calls.
A bevy of top local stars will be suiting up in camouflaged gear to portray various military personnel, from new recruits to reservists and high-ranking commanders. Some of them, including Shane Pow, will even be shaving their heads.
“This is my second time shaving my head for a role, but I’m fine with it as this is my last time playing a recruit!” exclaimed the 26-year-old actor, who also went bald for 2013’s The Recruit Diaries, in an interview with Toggle at yesterday’s (Feb 20) lensing ceremony.
In addition, the former Manhunt finalist, who plays a naval officer trainee, will have a topless scene in the show, and promised to showcase a much better physique compared to his previous body-baring adventure in last year’s House of Fortune. “I’m going to go back to a stricter diet and spend more time training,” he said. “I aim to look like a proper soldier instead of a reservist who eats too much! (laughs)”
While Shane’s co-star, famed “hunkle” Zheng Ge Ping, is not required to forgo his shirt at the moment, there is a possibility for that to be arranged. However, the 52-year-old, who plays an Air Force pilot, told us that he will have a discussion with the director beforehand as he feels that his current form is not 100 percent up to his high standards (just “75 to 80 percent” there, in case anyone’s wondering).
As for Romeo Tan, who plays a company commander, he’s aiming for a sun-kissed complexion when filming commences. “I’m naturally very fair, so I need to work harder to maintain a slight tan – but I won’t be as dark as Desmond (Tan)!” said the 31-year-old with a laugh.
The ladies of 'When Duty Calls': Jasmine Sim, Paige Chua, Felicia Chin
Two of the roses among the thorns are Felicia Chin and Paige Chua, who play a combat medic and navy captain respectively.
Felicia, who now sports drastically cropped locks (courtesy of celebrity coiffurist David Gan), jokingly complained that her hair is now shorter than that of boyfriend Jeffrey Xu’s, but gushed about how much easier it is to take care of. The makeover was suggested by her stylists, who thought it would suit her and her character.
Besides the mane change, the 32-year-old is also watching war films, such as Hacksaw Ridge, to prepare for her role. She also plans to bulk up slightly in order to look more convincing as a fit army medical officer.
When we asked Paige why she didn’t follow in Feli’s footsteps and go for a short cut, the 35-year-old actress shared that it wasn’t her call. “I also thought I would need to look like a tough cookie, but my character, while firm and fierce when she’s on duty, is actually very gentle and feminine,” she said.
Paige also revealed a surprising fact about herself: before she went into modelling, she considered joining the military, and even applied to become a paramedic (however, she was rejected). “I was physically active so while I don’t think I’d made a perfect soldier, I wouldn’t be too bad!”
While their onscreen military journey is about to begin, the male cast members already had army day tales to regale us with: who rated himself a 9.9 upon 10 on the “siao on” (over enthusiastic) scale, and who had a terrifying supernatural encounter on Pulau Tekong? Read on for more:

U see this country like china different, they want to show ppl that their training is harsh but produce good soliders, so they keep producing army drama like this:  
Females who can march 200km and successfully finish their mission within 3 days? 
Even inside SAF commando also different to find normal commando who can do but that is my point, china just want to see its audience how satki their soliders is, even if they  exaggerate a lot.","

"150","SexyLeeAnn"," I think a lot have to do with Producers' and Directors' casting choices. Producers and Directors have a lot of say in casting. So it really depends as to whether they think this actor or actress can pull off the role. And it's also about timing and luck too. Every actor or actress will have a moment in their career when they would be given opportunities to shine or break through.  So if that actor/actress had been putting in effort to hone his/her acting skills and when the right role comes, he/she gave it all, most often than not, it will have good results. But if the drama is aired in a wrong timing or season, maybe lesser people will watch that drama, then results not that significant? But it all started with an opportunity and whether you have shown to Producers and Directors you are ready for certain roles or willing to push your envelope and venture into new roles.","

"253","twinkle07","ITS A WRAP: After three months of filming for upcoming Channel 8 drama, When Duty Calls, our local actors bade goodbye to the drama with a bang. The last two major scenes for the drama, which will see loads of stunts, high-level special effects and participation from real-life military personnel (Eds note: Close to 40 servicemen from the SAF and Home Team and even a Battalion Casualty Station, four Fast Response Vehicles and a Red Rhino, were involved in this terror attack scene) were filmed and completed within the last two weeks. The scenes, which were filmed at Mattar MRT Station on the Downtown line, saw Felicia Chin, Desmond Tan, Paige Chua and Jasmine Sim helping with the evacuation efforts as the terrorists had planted bombs both inside a train, as well as at Mattar MRT Station itself. Both Desmond and Paige also sustained injuries from their heroic efforts. However, it was a bitter-sweet farewell for the stars whom Toggle spoke to on-site. I was really happy while filming this series, the camaraderie between my co-stars were great. We have a total of four directors for this drama, but we [the actors] were given the freedom to discuss how we wanted to flesh out our characters, and even change our lines to better suit our characters occasionally. I really enjoyed the filming process, Desmond Tan shared. It seems that the trying times and physical challenges that the cast experienced together throughout the course of filming had brought them closer together. When Pierre Png was shooting his final outdoor scene on May 17, co-star Romeo Tan came down to the filming site, a scorching hot side-road just outside the Nicoll Highway MRT station, with drinks in hand for the cast and crew. Other than bringing drinks and much-needed encouragement, Romeo also stayed for a good two hours, snapping pictures and observing the action. Similarly, when Desmond, Paige, Felicia and Jasmine filmed their big scene, where they were caught in a train station that had bombs planted in and around it by terrorists, co-stars Kym Ng and her on-screen son, new face Richie Koh made a trip down to the filming site, to offer some much-needed moral support and snacks. Click on to find out more about what went down during filming these two days! Desmond Tan All eyes were on Desmond that day, who shared that his character will get injured while attempting to save a kid as a bomb goes off in the train station. In order to craft his ultra-realistic wound, the actor had two special effects makeup artists working on his arm, to make it look more roughed up. The 30-year-old also had to strip out of his shirt for a scene, where hell be wheeled out of the train station in a stretcher, due to his serious injuries. Desmond shared that filming for When Duty Calls has left him with a very welcome present. Ive gotten more fit over the past few months. While filming, Ive become more toned and muscular, and put on close to six kilogrammes, all of it muscle mass, the actor shared. Desmond also revealed that when faced with a similar situation in real life, he believes that hell be pretty similar to his character. I will definitely try to step up and help. While it will definitely be harder if they have weapons, I will enlist the help of others to help subdue them [the terrorists]. We cant all be sitting ducks waiting for death anyway, Desmond declared. Paige Chua While the actual bomb blasts and explosions will be added into the scene in post-production, with the help of special effects, Paige shared that shed love to have the chance to experience a reel-life explosion, complete with real fire and special effects in one of her future dramas, if possible. I do feel honoured to be involved in this production. Other than being able to gain access to a number of top-secret military areas while filming, Im also able to experience the feeling of being in a leadership role in the military (Paige plays a naval captain in the drama), without actually going through BMT (Basic Military Training) and enduring hardships, Paige, who previously shared that a number of unsuspecting servicemen had greeted her while she was in character at a naval base, laughed. Felicia Chin The ever-chirpy actress, who plays an army medic in the show, shared that she had done a lot of research before filming commenced, in order to better understand her role, as well as the different protocols and army lingo used by true-blue army medics. Ive asked many different people close to me [for help], and some of them happen to be medics as well. So Id ask them, Why did you choose to sign on and become a medic?, and more. Sometimes, when theres a break during filming, Ill take the opportunity to approach some of the servicemen and medics and ask them more about their roles as well, she shared. The actress also added that she hopes to be able to portray an accurate picture of what being an army medic is really like. Pierre Png Unlike the rest of the actors, who filmed both indoors and outdoors for their final scenes, Pierres scene was fully outdoors, with filming taking place from 8am till 6pm. When Toggle caught up with Pierre his break at around 3pm, the actor was taking shelter in the shade of one of the military vehicles involved in the shoot, looking visibly tired, and for good reason. In that particular scene, Pierre and his fellow military personnel were involved in a stand-off with the terrorists, who had managed to breach their first point of defence. There will also be a gun-fight between the two parties, which resulted in a number of casualties. As a result, Pierre had to run back and forth in the hot sun multiple times, readying his equipment and getting into position, a task that understandably tired him out. However, the actor confessed that he much preferred filming in his army uniform, despite the sweltering weather. Its more comfortable [as compared to filming in civilian wear]! Im not sure how to explain it, but Im sure that all the servicemen whove served in the army before will get me, Pierre shared. He also let on that when he first received his script, this was the scene that he was most looking forward to. This is actually my characters first time doing his in-camp training, and he has to learn a lot of things. But, his attitude slowly changes as the drama progresses. My character finally gets a chance to protect his country in this scene as well, and it really does feel like a perfect ending, the actor let on.

Meanwhile, Lu Junguang and Chen Jinbao discover a homemade bomb while patrolling the MRT station. They notify the relevant authorities at once and the bomb is attended to. Nonetheless, it goes off and Junguang is hit. He lies motionless on the ground. The clock turns back a year. Junguang has been called back for In-Camp Training. During an inspection, a bra is found in his field pack and he is severely reprimanded by Longbin, the officer in command. Junguang’s elder sister, Meiguang, owns a bread shop. Due to a lack of staff, she has to make deliveries herself. She is plagued by misfortune. At night, Longbin and Junguang find Jinbao making out with a woman in a car. The woman goes berserk and tries to stab Jinbao after learning he has no intention of marrying her. Meiguang advises her son, Lu Xianfeng, to fail his NAPFA test so that he will be assigned to a less physically demanding unit during his National Service. Junguang reminds her that those who fail the NAPFA test are enlisted eight weeks earlier for more intensive training. Longbin realises Jinbao is the son of his boss. He is disappointed when Jinbao is promoted to Operations Director instead of him. Meiguang tries to matchmake Junguang and Bai Jingyu. However, Junguang only regards Jingyu as a friend. He is interested in Shen Yixuan. Yixuan is an officer in the Navy. During a mission, she is held hostage by a group of terrorists.    ","

Junguang, Longbin and Jingyu are on overseas training stints. Their training ends and they are about to head home when an earthquake happens. Jingyu is hit by a falling shelf when she tries to save Junguang.    ","

How will Des react to Paige's sudden change of heart? 
Watch on... 
But i have to say, rem to watch ep 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 for Paige and Des... they have so little precious screen time together! 
I suspect drama will start from episode 10 onwards until...maybe episode 18 then we may get the beautiful ending... then epi 19 and 20 wld be back to epi 1's storyline...terrorist scenes...","

Probably desmond wanted to propose to her but she still cannot move on from ""roger that"" dead ex bf...
Then the very last scene in the video, paige was crying and hugged desmond... so i guessed they reconciled in the end...
Otherwise, in epi 1, paige wouldnt call desmond and told him she was on her way home after seeing the doc for her injured knee or leg? （This scene is actually the future scene... what we are watching now is probably 1 year before terrorist scenes in epi 1.）Then both sweetly asked each other to be careful... im guessing they reconciled right before the terrorist scenes... 
Paige also said in 933 radio interview, she and desmond will have happy ending after twists and turns... im guessing felicia probably almost shaken Desmond's heart too...","

Although im not a fan of Felicia, i feel edmw-ers should not be so nasty towards her. I think she acted quite okay in this drama...and i sympathise and emphathise with her character's rejected position and having unrequited feelings towards Desmond's character... 
I hope I wont get angry at Paige's latter decisions in the drama... although i guess it is very difficult to let go of deep feelings for a deceased love one... so many what ifs... so many if i coulds... and memories meddling with your mind and heart...","

She is in mostly episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.
Was she in episode 3? I think a short while with Jasmine Sim?
I read the iweekly synopsis of episodes 6 - 10... i think she is not in episodes 8, 10.
This drama has too many characters.
20 episodes only...
Every time, when it comes to NS scenes, i will fast forward. Some days, some episodes are more focused on Shane, Richie and Jasmine. Then, some days are more focused on Desmond, Paige, Felicia. Sometimes, a couple on Pierre, Kym, Romeo, Meixin, ZGP...
On a side note, not to be bad ass here but i sincerely hope those folks who want to reminisce about past NS camps or NS days, can shift their nostalgic discussion to another thread. As much as I am happy to see such fond memories laid out in the thread, it makes it hard for others to sift through the thread to look at posts regarding the drama... 
Thread starter, able to help moderate here?

Not even the recovery truck or tank can get it out?Actually tbh, why SAF hung onto the SM-1s for so long? From when it first went into service, it only seems useful as an infantry fire support platform because of the 75mm gun and thin armour. Because 'Once Armour, Always Suffer!"" And EDMW is the best place to share  for its small size and the gun accuracy in less than 1.5km if you need to fight in rubber plantation (u get the hint?). but my era was the year armour was trying out many different platforms liao. bro nomoreliaola should know what vehicles my unit was operating before switching back to SM1 and M113.","

"1807","Ponpon830","		Tmr is episode 5. Yes Paige is in it. She is in mostly episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Was she in episode 3? I think a short while with Jasmine Sim? I read the iweekly synopsis of episodes 6 - 10... i think she is not in episodes 8, 10. This drama has too many characters. 20 episodes only... Every time, when it comes to NS scenes, i will fast forward. Some days, some episodes are more focused on Shane, Richie and Jasmine. Then, some days are more focused on Desmond, Paige, Felicia. Sometimes, a couple on Pierre, Kym, Romeo, Meixin, ZGP... On a side note, not to be bad ass here but i sincerely hope those folks who want to reminisce about past NS camps or NS days, can shift their nostalgic discussion to another thread. As much as I am happy to see such fond memories laid out in the thread, it makes it hard for others to sift through the thread to look at posts regarding the drama...  Thread starter, able to help moderate here? Thank you in advance for your kind understanding...   Let them share here la since this drama is abt ns. Quite refreshingto read. Drama only got so much to discuss. Btw, I really like the cast in this show. Most if not all R Singaporean?","

Did not actually follow through this drama but just noticed that the acting from most of the artists are ok and up to par. Unfortunately, they are just getting all the standard stereotype artist into their usual roles and there is no breakthrough. Even the ancient kungfu period drama that they have produced are much better than most of the dramas now. And they have the face to hao lian they have 35 years experience of making drama.","

Well...
The most successful drama this year so far is Mightiest Mother in Law...
Most of SG and perhaps some M'sia Chinese also tuned in on time to watch in April and May earlier this year.
They probably wasted a lot of money on The Lead... it was really not worth my time watching... story line just sucks...
As for When Duty Calls... like we said... it is cramming so many love lines into 20 episodes. There are 4 groups of key characters. Each group's scenes will probably last 5 full episodes if edited out.
1) paige desmond felicia james darryl
2) pierre kym zheng ge ping
3) romeo mexin

But can tell she is trying different types of characters?

She still gets 1st female lead roles leh... but her next two dramas are not in the 9pm slot...
As for Paige...she really is probably at her prime now... i hope her next drama in 2018 after My Friends From Afar will cast her as the first female lead...
Hopefully in a drama about air stewardess and pilots...
I even can imagine the front cover she can do for 8 Days or iWeekly...for that drama... hahaha
She in a pilot uniform in the centre showing a sexy androgynous look while surrounded by other male pilots...
A double cover wld be the male lead in pilot outfit surrounded by air stewardess...

2010 till 2015 -- rui en, jeanette, rebecca, jesseca liu, joanne peh.
Rebecca's growth and popularity surged during this period... she even won best supporting and best actress during this period...
2015 till present -- rebecca, paige, felicia (she kept getting roles, so im guessing she is still on the producers' top lists?), rui en (at least 1 drama a year but recently took on an even lower profile due to negative publicity), carrie wong (she has quite a few opportunities too), julie tan (mdc still treating her as a talented actress it seems)....","

"2116","Medicated Oil","2017 till future - Jasmine, Ying Ying and the kids of the artist. Rebecca - tried hard to change her type cast under the LEAD. Did not really grasp her role in that drama. Woody - Demoted to 118 X 2. Wasting time doing that silly drama. Joanne - Disaster return with the china slang. Need help with her acting as there is not much improvement. Rui-en - No issues with her acting. Seems like her antics are giving the management too much headache. Julie - Limited to certain roles. Better for her to explore other opportunities in which she is doing now. Carrie - Given a lot of chances by MC. But, every performance is too Carrie. Unable to breathe different life in her character. Hayley & Jayley - They are improving with every drama but will be limited in their roles due to their height. Felicia - Need a lot of luck to get her breakthrough. Or else she will stay forgettable. Dawn - MC dun really give her any role to cast. Dunno what happened. Fiona - Welcome back ? Have to see whether she improved in her next drama. Jessica - No problem with her acting so far. Not sure about MC plan for her.","

"2117","SexyLeeAnn","Jasmine -- she has a unique look but acting wise, she really needs more practice. At this stage, im not so sure if she is heading down the right path... maybe she shld stick to modeling which may give her more success?
Ying Ying -- she is okay in acting... quite natural in line delivery... but really have to surpress the ""lian"" aura... hahaha i mean if she has to pull off professional roles, cannot still have that lian streak right?
Hong Ling -- she is pretty no doubt... but to surpass vase level, need time to tell. I havent watched her act before...so no comments...
The Woo twins -- pretty, photogenic... limited by height... but they shld try to be cast in roles that are not someone's younger sister...or the like...
Lin mei jiao's daughter -- i like her. She has potential. Not the first look pretty type but 耐看。","

Dont think these two have anymore kissing scenes to come. Ep 4 kissing scene shld be the 1st and the last kissing scene for Des and Paige...

Honestly I feel this is a pretty well done drama, second only to Mata-Mata  Des is injured so also understandably... he cannot grab or caress Paige's face properly to kiss her lah... moreover, maybe he wont dare to force kiss her again since she was pissed off from that kiss in ep 4.
She wld be disillusioned with Darryl... 
To be frank... their chemistry not as strong as Des and Paige together...
Look out for ep 11, 13, 14, 15... 
But you may be angry with Captain Sim in ep 13, 14... drama rama...
I pity Felicia's character...
What is the purpose of Bai Jing Yu's existence?
To show there is a possibility of platonic love?
Give her a love interest who will love her back lah!
Yeah i think the production team put in a lot of effort in this drama...

Hungry, catch fish, eat raw. Lost, no need to navigate, anyhow walk until find someone. and I paraphase Desmond's character ""i survive thanks to survival skills i learned from SAF"" I cannot see what he did has any need to be taught.","

As she said she is serious about being together with him, but probably she feels that he deserves the best but she doesn't know if she can give him that.

"4165","Medicated Oil","I guess your relatives that have a change of heart is either having a mid-life crisis or having a awakening over their marriage. The fairy tale marriage is rare and ideal in real life. Most of the married couples are suffering in silence or having some dead heart over their partners. At least your relatives take steps to ""improve"" their life instead of remaining in a loveless marriage. I know it will be disheartening for the wife when the hubby betrayed them. But, life is also giving them to find another chance to find some one to love them more.","

Without the love triangle, I dun think that the drama will attract the female viewers. Dun think they want to re-make the BMT training since they have covered the same topic a few times. The normal story of a NS men is actually quite boring. But, the reality of the drama is quite far-stretched since you can find the same clusters of uniformed people dating and finding partners in the army.","

"4170","SexyLeeAnn","    Spoiler!     
I watched already!
So touched by Desmond and Paige's scenes...
But too few scenes of them in this drama...
I'd rather they take out kym and pierre's scenes and give more air time to Desmond and Paige!
One thing is... all three of them... Paige, Felicia, Desmond did really well in their crying scenes...in ep 20...
Can see they have matured in terms of acting skills... the depth of their emotions and timing of tears... really natural...
Desmond really surprised me with his innate skills when Felicia broke up with him and he himself knows he really made a mistake of being with Felicia on a rebound effort but deep down he truly deeply loves Paige... there was a moment the tears in his reddened eyes were emerging... omg... the mixture of guilt plus feeling apologetic plus immense worry for Paige...
As for Paige... wow! When she confessed to Desmond she can only think about him before she fainted... that tear that dropped from her left eye... wow perfect timing... her crying scenes really damn good! One of her best scenes in this drama...
Felicia also did well in her solo crying scene while walking on the bridge... that painful resigned to her fate and realisation that she can never get the heart of the man she likes... yeah she did good for her role... really felt like sayanging her...
But babe... you know when Desmond and Paige hug for the 2nd time at the hospital... after that they should go in for a gentle passionate kiss on the lips... but they didnt... such a let down... sigh...
I believe a kiss to forever seal their love for each other wld be perfect for that moment...
Dont you think so...?    ","

The young actress need time to grow. So, give her a chance. Just look at Ying Ying on how she improved from the initial act. Rebecca and Carrie are also still finding their way even after so many lead roles.","

Oh yah... why you say Rebecca and Carrie still finding their way?
I thought Reb won two acting awards?
She bao ka liao already leh...
Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress...
Still finding her way meh?
As for Carrie... I dont really watch much of her dramas... so no comments...
I think Paige and Jesseca will be the main audience pullers in these two years...
Actually Julie Tan is not bad too...","

"4372","Medicated Oil","Jessica is convincing in most of her roles. But, she is not really ambitious like the rest. So, I am not sure whether she will retired after she have a baby. Paige is rising but need to be managed carefully or else over-exposure will kill her. Was expecting Rebecca to shine in the previous drama. However, I find that she is not really convincing in acting dumb as compared to Rui En and Jessica. I am not sure whether it is the constraint of her facial feature or her acting. Just feel that she have not got her breakthrough yet. Carrie, as I mentioned before, still show her attitude in every roles that she is doing. Not really convincing in most of her portrayal. Her acting is still very carrie-ish. Julie knows that she will be getting the tomboyish role or spoilt gal role in TCS which will not help her in her growth. That is why she dump them and is expanding her portfolio. It is a smart move and she got strong financial backing. Eyes is the window of the soul. If you have not mastered the eyes, you are not even close to acting yet. Ying ying, Kym, Pan Ling Ling and Xiang Yun got it. Carrie and Rebecca still finding their way. Just my humble observation.","

This year alone 4 dramas have her name inside... Hero (continued from 2016), Mightiest Mother in Law, When Duty Calls, My Friends from Afar.
If this year Paige was not cast in those roles, I probably wouldnt be interested to watch MediaCorp dramas...
She has to thank the producers of Hero and MMIL for casting her... really help to open up her acting range... 
Oh and about over exposure...
I think no need to worry...
It is probably coincidential that this year several producers all thought she fit those roles in their dramas...
Who knows in 2018 she only gets cast in 2 dramas? While Carrie gets more roles?
Unless it is obvious more and more producers really like to cast Paige, i think this sort of thing is all about timing and luck...","

"4390","SexyLeeAnn","		reb seems to have quiet down recently?  No leh...
Her new drama coming out in oct i think...
Then 1 more drama airs then paige's new alien drama....
Reb is shooting ch5 drama with pierre now...
Missing 2.
Reb is gd in professional roles...
But her comedic timing is not there yet...
Paige has proven she can do dramatic, auntie, comedic bimbo, professionals...
I want to see her play a real baddie for once...
Bad until you wanna slap her just like how tong bing yu was so good in her vixen role in MMIL...
If there is a medical drama about doctors, surgeons, like 白色巨塔 but singapore version... starring paige and rebecca as rival doctors / specialists in a private hospital... should be quite interesting...
This time round i hope paige's role is an ambitious selfish smart doctor and can be manipulative when she wants to get her way...but later she slowly changes for the better...after going through life changing experiences...and being with a good natured male lead.
Reb is probably the typical goody girl from rich medical family but slowly becomes trapped in the politics of medical world and she became manipulative towards the end...and lost her conscience...
Both roles will be very challenging for these two ladies... will be interesting to watch... audience pullers...
For the male leads, who should you recommend?","

"4399","SexyLeeAnn","So in that medical drama...for Reb Vs Paige.
The storyline goes like this...
I put spoiler tags because it is long.    Spoiler!     
Paige is a senior specialist in heart surgery (okay cant decide on which organ to specialise, but she is a surgeon for sure...)
She comes from middle class background and is the only one in her family to graduate from university and became a surgeon. Since young, she had to work part time to pay for her sch fees and allowance, but she was smart enough to also win scholarships to finish her medical bachelors and masters... because of her upbringing, having to fend for herself all the time... she has became rather selfish and ambitious within 10 years of working in the medical field... her aim is to be head of surgery and she reckon staying in a public hospital will not help her.
Thus, she recently join a private hospital to be deputy head of surgery. 
She is firm, efficient, self centred, manipulative... even her bf cldnt stand her coldness towards the poor and elderly and early on in the drama, broke up with her. She is working towards her phd when the drama starts...
Reb is the heiress of the private hospital but she wants to work her way up by working as a senior specialist in internal medicine.
She is blessed since birth and is always elegant, kind, generous towards others.
Aware of the conflicts between her relatives and family members, she has vowed not to be involved but eventually she wld get sucked into the cold hearted political fiasco of the private hospital. During this process, she slowly realises she has to be heartless in order to protect the hospital, her family and the things she wants.
Reb has a longtime bf since university. In between those years, she and the bf were studying in different foreign countries for their masters and phd. The bf specialises in Anesthesiology and is considered one of the best Anesthesiologists in Sg. but later this bf will break up with Reb & be with Paige...    ","

Wah ZZH alone has 4 dramas this year! Full length ones some more... so every two to 3 months we will see him on TV at 9pm...

"4408","SexyLeeAnn","I havent thought of the side stories...
Hahaha... 
But more details on the storylines below...    Spoiler!      
Paige is eager to make her mark at the private hospital she just joined.
But her high standards and firm attitude make it very pressurising for the surgery team to work with her...
She is exceptionally tough on new surgeons as she expects their surgical skills to be almost perfect...
One day, she suffers yet another blow when her bf of 5 years decides to break up with her because he realises she has changed from that ambitious full of hope resident doctor to a cynical realistic selfish surgeon.
He is a senior executive at a pharmaceutical company. They met while Paige was doing her residency at the public hospital and he was the sales rep for medicine that the hospital is purchasing from his company.
Although feeling saddened and shocked by the breakup and discovering he is already starting to date the daughter of his boss, she decides to devote her full attention to her career.
Reb on the other hand was asked by her father (chairman) to join the board of directors as he feels it is the right time now. She doesnt want to and tries to push it off or postpone it but her father says out of her siblings and her, he can only trust her now. Reb feels the family pressure mounting on her, and her slibings and relatives start to realise she has become the new threat in their fight to win executive control of the private hospital.
Reb's bf, let's call him The BF, since dont know who shld play him... 
He is a kind hearted anesthesiologist who volunteers his time at the nursing home to help do free medical health checks on the elderly    ","

"4409","SexyLeeAnn","I thought lightning is a better name...? Haha...
Last year 2016 Paige had more exposure than this year....
She had about 4 dramas i think.
That msia drama abt middle age crisis of terence cao's character (she is the 3rd party), if only i could, the gentlemen, hero, plus a toggle drama with romeo and ian fang...
0.5 for hero, 0.5 for toggle drama...
This year, strictly speaking, she has 3.5 dramas. The 0.5 is hero as it only ended airing in Jan 2017. So lesser exposure than last year... 
Busy is gd news for artistes....no?
But also wonder wldnt she burn out? 
Like one production ended, must shoot the next one almost immediately...
Funnily, in 2012, she only had 1 drama, maybe that was a long length drama... 
She has another drama end of year, My Friends from Afar...
I think Carrie has more scenes perhaps (she seems to be the main female lead) thus maybe Paige can rest abit hahaha...","

How come!?
Pierre Png, Desmond Tan, Thomas Ong...

Carrie - Lucky to get main role after the bean curd gal character. - Her acting career is pretty smooth since then. - All her previous characters are similar and do not really require any acting skills.  - For this Alien role, she need to create something to make this character unique. It is up to her on whether she did her homework or not. - She will be under a lot of scrutiny if she do not perform well just like Ms White. She may not recover from this setback.","

This army drama doesnt require her to create new mannerisms or behaviour...
I think she mentioned this Sim Yixuan character is 80% like her real life persona...
But to me, i think to act yourself in a drama can be another form of challenge by itself...
Dont know how to explain...
Her crying scenes this time are more innate compared to MMIL... i think this is an improvement on her innate acting skills as i rem some pple actually commented she is not that gd in 内心戏... 
However in this drama, there are some scenes in which she has shown pretty good 内心戏...because she is supposed to be strong and 坚强, as she is a Navy captain. 
eg. The recall of ex bf's death scene in episode 5, the worrying for junguang scene in yusloka in epi 6, the guilty towards junguang and missing ex bf scene in epi 14, etc.","

"5076","seeseelooklook","You all talk like never serve ICT before.
ICT not so easy to defer one. Depends on the MINDEF, CO and OC and your previous performance.
Like CO will ask OC if this guy deferment application should be approved. If this guy is a slacker during ICT, you think OC will say ok? 
For pregnancy, like someone said earlier, if within 1 month from EDD, likely can defer, especially if the ICT is not that important. Or if the pregnancy has complications and with certification from gynae, higher chances of deferment.
OR you may be asked to come back only on important days for key activities only. Then you will be considered as served the ICT.
Generally, if the soldier is average performer and above during ICT, OC will approve OFF PASS quite readily one (at least for me). Especially when there is nothing much on the timetable. BUT key activities still cannot be missed. Unless it is really important stuff that you really need to attend to in person like exams etc. Things like interview is subjective because usually ICT timetable is released way beforehand and you could have arrange your interview on another day.
For those females reading this thread, ask your hubby or bf for the ICT timetable. Don't let them bluff you about night training or outfield when there is none. Most likely, they organised their own ""cohesion"" or ""live firing already.

"5087","All in a Day","I think by and large, most guys are abiding and accept and attend ICTs as part of the SG life just like they have accepted NS. But the system has always been one with many loopholes to exploit and sometimes ""aided"" by cock-ups. E.g. people who defer frequently typically get 'kicked out' of their units and with that there is a probability that they do not get re-assigned to another unit and get forgotten.. Those who are out to exploit will find their ways to continue doing so when they get their next call-up etc. But the cock-ups also penalize folks who just want to clear their ICT ASAP and get on with life.. I know of people who attend their ICTs but get 'kicked out' of their units into a few ICTs for unknown reasons, get forgotten for awhile and then made to resume ICTs down the road. They end up as those odd few lao pengs in their ICT units where their time should be better spent with family and kids. I find the commando ICT path to be best (assuming no downgrade). Complete a relatively short cycle and MR when you hit early 30s at the latest and get on with family life etc.","

I just hope they can produce those two drama stories i proposed in this thread for Paige and Desmond... the one about airline service, and the 白色巨塔 style one...
No need blockbuster dramas like The Lead (really waste money)...
Just give us gd stories, gd quality productions with gd actors and actresses... 
Wu Shu Lin and Zhang Long Min are pretty gd producers... they have a gd eye for casting the right actors/actresses for their dramas...
I dont know when i will stop watching local dramas again...but now im intrigued, so while i am beginning to appreciate local dramas again, i really hope i can watch gd productions soon!","

If paige realises she actually loves desmond...(oh god like for real, 2nd time realisation)... when she returns to SG from yusloka, if she knows desmond and felicia are together, what would you think she will do?
1. Cry in silence, full of regrets and diam diam.
2. Dont care about felicia. Just go and re-declare her love for desmond.
3. Slowly re-appear in Desmond's life and slowly snatch him back...
4. Feels regretful but lawyer woos her again, she just says okay, i will take you roger that imitation.

"5425","SexyLeeAnn","The media and press anyhow write during production commencement press con in Feb 2017 that Felicia is first female lead, Paige is 2nd female lead...
But truth is Paige is the actual first female lead... while Felicia has even lesser scenes than Kym...
Paige's star power really rose even before MMIL was aired in April 2017, and do take note the script was probably finalised by Feb already...
Hope she gets better roles in future too...
Seems like SG audience really dig her now...","

Maybe there are more scenes for Felicia in the initial plan but removed after the editing.","

"5972","FlashBack","2 things that kept me watching the drama series along the way: nostalgia of the army scenes (although pretty inaccurate and exaggerated), and some pretty nice candid acting moments (most of which were from tan kim poh) This final episode however, totally destroyed the whole show. Everything was just flying by and happening with no logic and sense, they weren't even trying.  All the story & relationship elements they tried to build over the past 19 episodes, suddenly didn't matter anymore....like all of a sudden, the characters and what they've been through, become so detached, and all so haphazardly wrapped up by this big sudden event. It felt no different from watching one of those government-funded enactment scenes you see at train stations.... ","

I seldom chat in edwm forum...and only resurface when it is IT show, PC show, etc, and only check out threads in the special events sub-forum.
Im a workaholic...
But once in a while, if there is a drama that intrigues me...i do like to come here and see what are the comments...to see if that drama is worth watching...
First time was Mightiest Mother in Law...
And it was just so hilarious to see the Paige GIFs captured by some of you...
The comments were also damn funny...
Thus, it became an outlet for me to destress and take my mind off work...during the awful commute to work.
This When Duty Calls thread was also funny and informative because of the sharing of SAF knowledge...
This year, Im only interested in Paige's dramas, because they happened to be featuring interesting stories... Not sure if she made gd choices to accept these dramas or if she was chosen specifically by producers and directors... (She was not the no.1 choice for dramas produced 6 years ago and had actually replaced Joanne Peh when the latter declined the supporting actress role in Code of Honour in 2011.)
3 months later, her last 2017 drama My Friends from Afar will be airing...so see you all back here in edmw!
