<h3>Open Data in Singapore</h3>
<p>Hi again! For my second post, I would like to focus on exploring the open data sources available at <a href="https://www.data.gov.sg/">data.gov.sg</a>. But should one click on the link that I just provided and take a look at the available data sources, one would find an immense number of data sets available, and wouldn’t necessarily know where to begin!</p>

<h3>Load Packages</h3>
<p>First, let’s load some package that we will need.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)</code></pre>

<div id="reading-in-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Reading in the Data</h3>
<p>Next, let’s read in the data into our working environment using the provided <strong>API Key</strong>. After we read in the data (<em>in JSON format</em>), we realise that the API provides data, as well as the metadata of the dataset. In this case, because we are only interested in the records, we will only keep these.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data = fromJSON(&quot;https://data.gov.sg/api/action/datastore_search?resource_id=139a3035-e624-4f56-b63f-89ae28d4ae4c&quot;)
data = data$result$records</code></pre>
