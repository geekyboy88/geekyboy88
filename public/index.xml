      <description>Soccer Analytics My very first data analytics post! I would like to dedicate my first post to a sport/hobby that I have really enjoyed since I was young, Soccer! I still recall the first ever match that I watched: Manchester United vs Liverpool in the 3rd round of the FA cup in Unitedâ€™s treble winning season. United were 1-0 down to a goal from Michael Owen, but scored 2 goals right at the death to move on to the 4th round.</description>
